## WORKING WITH ISSUES

### Create a new issue:
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form..<br>

### Solve an issue:
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix..<br>

## MAKE NEW CODE CONTRIBUTION
To get an overview of the project, read the README. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions.<br>

### Finding ways to contribute with project:
- Set up Git.<br>
- GitHub flow.<br>
- Collaborating with pull requests.<br>
- Getting started.<br>
- To navigate our codebase with confidence, see the introduction to working in the docs repository.<br>

### Choose te repo:
To make new code you need to choose what repo are you looking for:<br>
Use the https://github.com/Giswater/docs repository to work with.<br>
Use the https://github.com/Giswater/giswater_qgis_plugin repository to work with.<br>
Use the https://github.com/Giswater/giswater_dbmodel repository to work with.<br>
Rest of repositories are no significant. Some of them they are deprecated or some of them are not used.

### Make changes locally:
1- Install Git LFS.<br>
2- Fork the repository.<br>
3- Using GitHub Desktop.<br>
4- Getting started with GitHub Desktop will guide you through setting up Desktop.<br>
5- Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to fork the repo!<br>
6- Using the command line: Fork the repo so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
7- Create a working branch and start with your changes!<br>
8- Commit your update.<br>
9- Commit the changes once you are happy with them. See Atom's contributing guide to know how to use emoji for commit messages.<br>
10- Once your changes are ready, don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process.<br>

### Create Pull Request:
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.<br>
Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.<br>
Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.<br>
We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments.<br>
As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved. Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the GitHub.<br>
