### Create Pull Request:

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.

Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.

We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved. Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the GitHub.
